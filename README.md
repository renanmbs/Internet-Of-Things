#Internet-Of-Things
<p>This Repository is to show my programming skills while using the Opl√° Arduino Kit, and the Arduino MKR1010 Wi-Fi board</p>
<p>It has some small projects that were created and later on incorporated in a bigger project </p>

<h3>Arduino</h3>
<h4>Programming Language: C++</h4>
<ul>
  <li>CSV files - Records CSV files into a SD Card based on readings from sensors</li>
  <li>Remote Triggers - Incorporates Arduino IoT Cloud into the system and control the board using the Cloud and Wi-Fi</li>
  <li>Temperature and Humidity - Read sensors and have the board adjust setting based on it</li>
  <li>User Input LED - Turn LED on/off based on LED input</li>
</ul>
